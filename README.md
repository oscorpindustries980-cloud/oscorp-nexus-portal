# Oscorp Quota Portal

Build a ultra-realistic, enterprise-grade B2B web application for "Oscorp Industries Corporation" using React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons, and Shadcn UI components.



DESIGN & THEME SYSTEM:

- Aesthetic: Ultra-clean, classy modern enterprise corporate look.

- Color Palette: Pure White (#FFFFFF) & Crisp Light Slate (#F8FAFC) background, Accent Emerald Green (#00E676 / #059669), Dark Forest Green (#064E3B) for primary headers, and Charcoal (#1E293B) for body text.

- Components: Glassmorphism cards, interactive data tables, status badges, toast notifications, and modal dialogs.



CORE ARCHITECTURE & FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:



1. ROLE-BASED AUTHENTICATION & LOGIN SYSTEM:

- Hardcoded Admin Credentials: Email "admin@oscorp.com" / Password "Admin2026!". Logging in with these credentials unlocks the "Admin Control Panel".

- Standard User/Vendor Login & Register Modal: Allows new users to create an account or sign in.

- Real-Time Account Status Engine: Include a toggle logic where if a user's status is set to "BLOCKED" by the admin, any attempt to perform actions shows a sticky red banner: "Your account has been suspended by Oscorp Admin."



2. PUBLIC LANDING PAGE & SERVICE HUB:

- High-Tech Hero Banner: "Oscorp Industries — Advanced Enterprise Quotation & Contract Portal".

- Quick Search / Status Tracker: A search bar on the hero section allowing users to enter a Reference ID (e.g., OSC-QT-90821) to check live quotation progress.

- Corporate Divisions: Interactive showcase for Genetics, Advanced Robotics, Aerospace, and Quotation Management.



3. CLIENT QUOTATION SUBMISSION MODULE:

- Drag-and-Drop File Upload Form: Clients can upload proposal documents (PDF, DOCX, ZIP).

- Dynamic Input Fields: Project Title, Estimated Budget, Department (Genetics/Robotics/HR), Target Contact Email (e.g. angeltripathi.2802@gmail.com), and Detailed Work Notes.

- Automatic Ref Generator: Upon submitting, generates a unique ID (e.g., OSC-2026-X8) and shows a success toast notification.



4. ADVANCED ADMIN DASHBOARD & CONTROL CENTER (Accessible via Admin Login):

- Live Analytics Cards: Total Quotations Received, Pending Review, Approved Contracts, Total Blocked Users.

- Interactive Quotation Approval Engine:

  * Table listing all submitted quotations with columns: Ref ID, Client Name, Email, Budget, Date, Status (Submitted / Under Review / Approved / Rejected).

  * Action Buttons: "Approve Quotation" (opens modal to set Final Approved Price & Admin Notes), "Reject Quotation", and "Download File".

  * Status Badge Changes: Updating status immediately reflects across the portal.

- Comprehensive User Management & Killswitch (Block/Unblock System):

  * User list table showing Name, Email, Role, Joined Date, and Account Status (Active/Blocked).

  * One-Click "Block User" Modal: Asks for a mandatory reason (e.g., "Policy Violation", "Unverified Documents") and updates user status to BLOCKED.

  * One-Click "Unblock User" feature to restore access.



5. EMPLOYEE & HR DIRECTORY (Public Verification Hub):

- Searchable Employee List: Search personnel by Reference ID (e.g., Shreya Kumari | Ref: OSC-IN-90821 | Quotation Specialist).

- Official Verification Badges & Document Dispatch Status updates.



6. UTILITIES & UI INTEGRATIONS:

- Top Sticky Header: Oscorp Emerald Logo, Navigation Links, Search, and Login/Admin Portal Switcher button.

- Live Toast Notifications (using Sonner / Shadcn Toast): Trigger realistic alerts when a quotation is submitted, approved, or when a user is blocked.

- Interactive Floating AI Assistant Widget: Answers FAQs about onboarding, email document dispatches, and quotation timelines.



Ensure all interactive states, mock data, filter options, active tabs, and modals work smoothly without any broken screens.
